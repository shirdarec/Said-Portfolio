# [Project I: Developing and optimizing with backtesting](https://github.com/shirdarec/Said-Portfolio/blob/main/Project_I-main/BollingerBand_optimized.ipynb)
* I picked the Bollinger Bands strategy, using the version that Rayner Teo ( famous youtuber in the trading community) used. 
* Using the yfinance library to get data from Yahoo Finance.
* Implemented the strategy with some tweakble paramteres 
* I used the plotly library to visualize the trade signals 
* Then I used backtesting library to further viusalize the results and the statistics   
* At last I made a table with all the different paramteres I tweaked to optimize the strategy
